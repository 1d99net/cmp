For a parcellation (=specific resolution), we need to provide a set of files:

* A GraphML network with only node information as data attributes:
- freesurfer structure name
- intensity value
- structure name
- href to cwiki

* A Freesurfer atlas with corresponding labels = intensity value

* A volume ??
